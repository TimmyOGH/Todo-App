### What I learned

In this project, I had a chance to work with many useState hooks and React DnD library. I learned quite a lot of useful techniques and implementations during this challenge. I'd love to say that I have truly improved so much in React from this.

### Continued development

I'd love to learn more about React as well as working with CSS frameworks.
